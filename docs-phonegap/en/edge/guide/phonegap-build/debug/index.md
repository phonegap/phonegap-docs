# Remote Debugging Tools

This section shows how to use standard Web Inspector tools available
from the [https://build.phonegap.com](PhoneGap&nbsp;Build site) to debug
PhoneGap apps while they are running on your device.  See the PhoneGap
Build section for details on how to provide the site with project
code, and how to get the resulting compiled apps onto your device.

To enable debugging from within the list of existing __Apps__, click
on the name of the application to view its details. Click on the
__Settings__ tab, then select the __Enable debugging__ check box:

![](img/guide/phonegap-build/pgbuild_dbg_select.png)

Once the debugging option is selected and you build the project, the
__Debug__ button appears along with other options to update code and
rebuild the project. When you preview the app on the device, perhaps
by scanning the QR code as described in the PhoneGap Build section,
pressing __Debug__ opens a web page that allows you to communicate
with the app as it runs on the device:

![](img/guide/phonegap-build/pgbuild_dbg_remote.png)

Pressing the listed target gives you access to the app's internal
state.  The debugger may occasionally lose its connection if you pause
the app or if the device goes into a standby mode. In that case, the
__Remote__ tab may present a new target with which to re-establish the
connection.

Once connected, the __Elements__ tab allows you to view the app's full
DOM tree as it executes:

![](img/guide/phonegap-build/pgbuild_dbg_elements.png)

You can use this interface to modify the application as it runs. For
example, the default PhoneGap app generated by the CLI (see The
Command-line Interface) presents a slowly blinking status message
beneath the icon:

![](img/guide/phonegap-build/pgbuild_dbg_blink.png)

Selecting various elements from the DOM tree in the debug view
highlights them on the device if visible, which may help you locate
the relevant code:

        <div id="deviceready" class="blink">

The sidebar on the right allows you to view information about CSS
properties applied to each element and the selectors that specify
them.  If you double-click on the `class` attribute and delete the
`blink` text, the message stops blinking on the device, and the
`.blink` selector disappears from the sidebar's __Matched CSS Rules__:

        .blink {
            -webkit-animation: fade;
            -webkit-animation-delay: initial;
            -webkit-animation-direction: initial;
            -webkit-animation-duration: 3000ms;
            -webkit-animation-fill-mode: initial;
            -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite;
            -webkit-animation-name: fade;
            -webkit-animation-timing-function: initial;
        }

To see the same change without editing the DOM, select the __Console__
tab and type a JavaScript call directly onto the command line. This
example selects the element whose `id` is `deviceready` and turns on
or off its `blink` class:

        document.querySelector('#deviceready').classList.toggle('blink')

The method's return value displays within the console. Typing the name
of _any_ object allows you to view its evaluated contents:

![](img/guide/phonegap-build/pgbuild_dbg_toggle.png)

The browser engine's error messages and results of `console.log()`
calls also appear on the console.

Navigating back to the __Elements__ view displays the results of the
change, but note there may be a delay, and you may need to re-select
the DOM node to view its current state.

The Web Inspector offers several other useful features:

* The __Network__ tab lists details on network requests the app makes
  while executing, along with a timeline interface to visualize a
  progression of network interactions.

* The __Timeline__ tab similarly visualizes load times for the app's
  component resources.

* The __Resources__ tab allows you to inspect cookies and the contents
  of various client-side databases (`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`,
  Web SQL) set by the Storage API.  Note that this view also allows
  you to inspect the HTML5 Application Cache, which allows you install
  an app persistently from a set of network resources. However, this
  feature is less appropriate for PhoneGap apps, which are already
  delivered to the device as part of an installed native package.

Despite slight differences in how Web Inspector features appear in
different WebKit-based browser environments, the documentation for
[Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/)
and
[Apple Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/DebuggingYourWebsite/DebuggingYourWebsite.html)
provides a good overview.

 # Using a Custom Debug Server

Adobe&reg; PhoneGap&trade; Build allows users to use their own debug
server with the Build service.

Build uses a tool called Weinre to enable remote debugging of
mobile apps.

This guide provides information on setting up your own local server.

The pre-requisites for running Weinre are that you need to have `npm`
installed.

Once you've installed Weinre you will only be able to use the local
server within your own network unless you plan to host it on a
publicly accessible location. This will require additional setup that
is outside the scope of this guide.

 ## Setting up Weinre

 ### Get Weinre

Once you have `npm` installed, obtaining and installing Weinre is as
simple as running the following command in a terminal.

        sudo npm -g install weinre

That's it! Now you're ready to run your very own Weinre instance.

 ### Start Weinre

To start your new local Weinre instance run the following command:

        weinre

You will now see output like the following:

        Hardeeps-MacBook-Air:~ hardeep$ weinre
        2013-07-01T20:03:34.890Z weinre: starting server at http://localhost:8080

Weinre is now up and running! If you are running this behind a router
that uses NAT you will need to find your IP address. You will use this
IP when specifying your configuration with Build.

 ## Using a Local Weinre Instance with Build

Obtain the ip address of your machine running Weinre. This can be done
on Windows by running `ipconfig` or on OSX/Linux by running
`ifconfig`.

Now you're ready to use your local server with Build. Using the
[config.xml](/docs/config-xml) specify the following. Change the
domain param value to the ip address you found earlier, and the key
param value to a unique identifier.

        <feature name="debug-server" required="true">
          <param name="domain" value="http://localhost:8080"/>
          <param name="key" value="[ a unique id for your app ]"/>
        </feature>

That's it! You can now upload this to Build, install it on your
device, and debug using your local Wienre server.

 ## Common Issues

__I can't connect to my Local Server__

First of all make sure that your server is running. Chances are if
you're using the default configuration you can visit
http://localhost:8080 and it should be responding.

If this works it's most likely the IP address you're providing to
Build; please verify that it is correct. A google search such as
`windows [version] find ip address` or `OSX [version] find ip address`
will help you find articles on getting the right ip.

Assuming that you're using a router running NAT verify that you can
visit it within your network by visiting http://[ip address]:8080.

# Collaborating and Testing

<!--

# Collaborating on Projects

When working with a team, apps are a collaborative undertaking.
PhoneGap Build hopes to create an easy to use and useful environment
for managing and building applications with many developers and
testers.


### Adding and Removing Collaborators:

To add or remove a user to your app, you will first need to head over
to your appsâ€™ detail page.

From there you will need to select the collaborators tab.

This tab provides a list of all collaborators associated with the
currently selected app.

To add a collaborator select the 'add a collaborator' button, enter
their email address, select a role, and hit send; they will now
receive an email stating you have shared the application.

If the new collaborator has not yet created a PhoneGap Build account
they will need to create one first and login; if they are logged in or
do not have an account will see a 404 page.

### What are the Tester and Developer roles for?

We allow you to specify one of two roles for a collaborator.

Testers can only download the app.

Developers can change the code, rebuild the app, and do anything short
of deleting the app or managing signing keys.

You can of course revoke people's access to your app, or change them
from a developer to tester.

### Have feedback?

We'd love to hear your thoughts on our collaborator workflow! If you
have any feedback on how we can improve collaboration on PhoneGap
Build or have a general question head over to our
[community](http://community.phonegap.com) page and start a
discussion!

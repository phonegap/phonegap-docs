### Windows Phone Dev Center Program Details
The [Windows Phone Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=258395) has a *one-time* registration payment of **$19** for individuals and **$99** for companies and allows 
 developers to submit apps to both the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store with no annual renewal fee. The setup is quick for publishing free apps to 
  the Windows Phone store but you will be required to create a tax profile and setup a payment account when you're ready to submit an app for purchase. 
  
<div class="alert--info">**NOTE:** If you have a Microsoft user account and want to associate it with your developer account then you'll need to be signed in with it first, otherwise you can create one at sign-up time. </div>


### Expected Timeframe
The timeframe from application submission to approval will be anywhere from 24 hours to 7 days depending on the features of your application and certification needed. 

### Resources
- Your application packaged in the form of an `.xap` file. See the [packaging docs](distribute/packaging-provisioning/windows) for more details on creating that file.
- Artwork:
  - Icons for Windows Phone Store
  - Screenshots of the app for the Windows Phone Store (minimum one screenshot in the highest resolution supported by your app and up to eight screenshots per resolution).
  - Optional promotional images (but recommended)

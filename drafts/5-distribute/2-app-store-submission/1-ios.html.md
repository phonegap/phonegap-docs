### Apple Developer Account Details
The [iOS Developer Account](http://developer.apple.com/) registration is **$99** per year for an individual. 
 
<div class="alert--warning">**NOTE:** An Apple ID is required to sign up. If you don't have one you will be able to sign up for one in the process.</div>

### Expected Timeframe
The timeframe for approval can run longer than the other platforms and take a week or more depending on the complexity of the app and if they reject it for any reason. 
To minimize the time take a look at some [common reasons for rejections](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/rejections/) before submitting your app since a rejection can cost up to another week. 
 
### Resources
- Your application packaged in the form of an `.ipa` file. See the [packaging docs](distribute/packaging-provisioning/ios) for more details on creating that file.
- Artwork:
  - Application Icons to be used for the App Store and Featured listings
  - Minimum of 1 screenshot per locale, up to 4 total. 
  <div class="alert--info">**TIP:** (See [Apple's specific screenshot requirements before preparing this artwork](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH26-SW2))
  - App Preview Video (optional but highly recommended)  
  <div class="alert--warning">**NOTE:** The device home screen app icon, splash screens and notification icons should have been included in your packaged app).</div>
- Other details on what you will be required to have for your application submission can be found in [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH26-SW7).  
   

### Steps Overview

3 Tools are mentioned in these steps - Apple Member Center, [iTunes Connect](iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa) and Xcode. A good diagram of the phases you may be using them  
can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/About.html).
 
1. Enroll in the [iOS Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action) through the Apple Developer Member Center. 
  <div class="alert--tip">**TIP:** If you're using In App purchases in your app, check out the [Application Loader tool](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/docs/UsingApplicationLoader.pdf)</div> 
2. Ensure you followed the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/)
2. Review the [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html)
3. Log in to [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa) with your Developer Account / Apple ID and [create a record](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/CreatingiTunesConnectRecord.html) for your application.
<div class="alert--info">**NOTE:** The iTunes Connect Portal allows you to manage your apps, view performance stats, manage pay contracts and more. You have access to it by default if you have an Apple Developer Account.</div>
4. Use [Xcode to upload your application package](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/SubmittingYourApp/SubmittingYourApp.html) (after completing the above step)

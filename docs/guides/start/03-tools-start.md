### PhoneGap App Creation Tools
Two desktop tools are available for creating PhoneGap projects, the **PhoneGap CLI** (command line interface) and the **PhoneGap Desktop App** (graphical user interface) tool.

Choose one of the tool buttons below to get started!

   <button>[PhoneGap CLI](/guides/cli/index.html)  </button><button>[PhoneGap Desktop](/guides/desktop/index.html)</button>


<div class="alert--info">**TIP:** If you're more comfortable using command line tools, choose the PhoneGap CLI option, otherwise start with the PhoneGap Desktop App. Both tools use the same underlying libraries and will allow you to quickly create and preview your app. </div>

PhoneGap is a framework that allows you to use HTML, JavaScript and CSS to build cross-platform mobile apps. It provides access to native device features
including the camera, compass, contacts, file system, GPS and many more.

In this Getting Started section we'll cover everything you need to know to get PhoneGap up and running so you can start building awesome mobile apps fast!

We'll start by going step by step from installing PhoneGap to creating and running your first mobile application on a device quickly. The rest of the Developer Documentation can then be used once you're up and running. It contains a bunch of useful information on configuring, debugging and distributing your app as well as covering general development tips you should be aware of when developing for mobile.

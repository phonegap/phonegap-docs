Now let's get our feet wet and create our first PhoneGap project. This project will become a mobile app with the ability to run on multiple devices and across operating systems in just a few simple steps.

###Default Hello World
The PhoneGap desktop tools include a default Hello World project for beginners to start with. It's proven to be the quickest and easiest way to understand the basics of building a mobile PhoneGap app so let's start there:

1. Click the plus sign and select *Create new PhoneGap project* as shown below:

2. You will be presented with a screen to enter information about your project. Enter the path on your local hard drive where you want to create the project, a designated name and an optional *identifier*. Once the information has been entered, click the green *Create project* button.

	<div class="alert--warning">**NOTE:** Be aware that the ID field is also known as the *package identifier* for Android and the *bundle identifier* for iOS.</div>

3.  You should now see a view like below, with your new project shown and marked with a left green sidebar, a green play button next to it and a green bar at the bottom with a server address indicating it's the active project and running.

   <div class="alert--info">**TIP:** The server address shown for your project at the bottom in the green bar will be used in the next step so make note of it or keep it open. </div>

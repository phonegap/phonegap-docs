### Configure, Develop, Debug, Distribute
Once you've become familiar with the getting started process for building mobile applications with PhoneGap and are ready for more, be sure 
to go on to the next sections in our PhoneGap Documentation site which include numerous tutorials and tips to help you configure, develop, 
debug and distribute your PhoneGap apps.  

### Build, Package and Distribute for Production

This getting started workflow is meant for beginning mobile application development with PhoneGap in the quickest and simplest manner. 
At some point you will want to move out of the sandbox environment and into a more advanced environment suitable for 
building, packaging and distributing your mobile application. 
 
Some options you have for taking your mobile application development to the next level for building, packaging and distributing are:

1. [Build and package locally using the PhoneGap CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface)
2. [Use PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) 
3. Use a 3rd party build tool

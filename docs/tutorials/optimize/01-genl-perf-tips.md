You can build your hybrid mobile applications to look and feel just like native apps by being aware of some important concepts and reap the benefits of both. 

In this section you'll learn about some different performance optimizations you can implement to increase the native feel and user experience of your own mobile hybrid applications.
 
The tips can be summarized into the following 10 general concepts. Click on each to find out more.  

1. Minimize loading time (reduce dependencies, serve images at resolution, use svg) 

2. Reduce the number of HTTP requests

3. Reduce rendering time - minimize reflows and repaints (don't alter the DOM while rendering)

4. Handle the known click delay

5. Provide proper UI feedback (instant on tap, handle gestures, remove obvious web feedback)

6. Optimize DOM/CSS selectors and JavaScript

7. Pre-fetch and load content in advance

8. Implement scrolling properly

9. Use hardware acceleration (carefully)

10. Use efficient JavaScript (don't block the UI thread)

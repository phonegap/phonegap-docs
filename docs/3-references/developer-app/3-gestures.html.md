There are a couple of supported gestures you should be aware of when using the PhoneGap Developer app.

### 3 Finger Tap
![3-finger Tap](/images/three-finger-tap.png) A 3-finger tap gesture will return you back to the home screen if you want to connect to a new IP address.

### 4 Finger Tap

A 4-finger tap gesture will cause the current application to refresh. The PhoneGap Developer app will automatically load any changes made
 but a forced refresh can be done with this gesture as needed.

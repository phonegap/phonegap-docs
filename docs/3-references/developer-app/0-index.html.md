## Overview

The PhoneGap Developer App runs on your mobile device and is used to preview the PhoneGap apps you're building quickly on a device. You simply connect PhoneGap Developer to the IP address of your app being served from either the PhoneGap Desktop app or the PhoneGap CLI running from a computer on the same network. The PhoneGap Developer app is like a sandbox type of environment with a pre-installed set of plugins available to use immediately as well without worrying about installing them. For a list of the plugins currently included, see the [FAQ](/references/developer-app/troubleshoot-faq).

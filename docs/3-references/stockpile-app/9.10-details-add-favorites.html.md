Now that there's an API available for favoriting items, you need to add some way to use it in the user interface so images can be favorited. A good place to do this is in the **Details** view.

In this lesson you will add a star icon to the navigation bar in the Details view that will be used to display and toggle the item's favorited status.

## Implement the UI
1. Open the `Details.vue` file
2. Replace the current `<f7-navbar.../>` block with the following snippet which now includes an empty or filled star icon to indicate if this image is a favorite or not (filled=favorite, empty=not), based on an `isFavorite` property you will add shortly. This new icon also has a click handler set on it which needs to call a function to toggle its status. You may notice it also specifies a dynamic `back-link` property bound to a computed property `backLink` you will code below: 

 ```html
    <f7-navbar :back-link="backLink" sliding>
      <f7-nav-center>
        Details
      </f7-nav-center>
      <f7-nav-right>
        <f7-link icon-f7="star_filled" @click="toggleFavorite"
          v-if="isFavorite"
        />
        <f7-link icon-f7="star" @click="toggleFavorite" v-else />
      </f7-nav-right>
    </f7-navbar>
```

  You should now have a star icon displayed on your navbar like in the image below:

  <img class="mobile-image" src="/images/stockpile/android/details.png" alt="Stockpile Details"/>

  
## Add JavaScript Handling
There are some additional changes to make to the JavaScript to enable the favorites handling.

1. In the computed properties block, add a new property called `displayingFavorite` to indicate if this item was selected off the favorites view or not. This code checks the route URL for the existence of a `displayingFavorite` parameter to determine if this view was a result of selecting an item in the favorites list or not.

 ```javascript
    displayingFavorite () {
      const { displayingFavorite = false } = this.$route.query;
      return !!displayingFavorite;
    }
```    
        
  <div class="alert--tip">In the Favorites view lesson you added a method `clickItem`, which defined a `displayingFavorite=true` parameter in the path when the details page is loaded, to indicate when the view was shown from Favorites specifically. </div>
   
2. Define a new computed property for for `backLink`, which uses the `displayingFavorite` property defined above  to determine where to go back to (either the **Favorites** list or **Results** list):

 ```javascript		
    backLink () {
      if (this.displayingFavorite) {
          return 'Favorites';
      } else {
          return 'Results';
      }
    }
```          

3. Add a computed property to check if an item is already a favorite by comparing id's to those in the existing `favorites` array: 

 ```javascript
    isFavorite () {
      const filteredFavorites =
        this.favorites.filter(favorite => favorite.id.toString() === this.id);
      return !!filteredFavorites.length;
    }
```

4. Update (or just replace) the `item` computed property with the following, to support an item being selected from the favorites view as well:
 
 ```javascript
    item () {
      // Fallback default for when images* and favorites* are reset in
      //  the store
      if (this.displayingFavorite) {
        if (this.favoritesById && this.favoritesById[this.id]) {
          this.stockItem = Object.assign(
            {},
            this.stockItem,
            this.favoritesById[this.id]);
        }
        return this.stockItem;
      }
      if (this.imagesById && this.imagesById[this.id]) {
        this.stockItem = Object.assign(
          {},
          this.stockItem,
          this.imagesById[this.id]);
      }
      return this.stockItem;
    }
```

5. Add an import for the `toggleFavorite` function created previously in the `favorites.js` file, just under the import for `moment.js`: 

 ```javascript
    import { toggleFavorite } from '../../utils/favorites';
```

6. Next, in your `methods` object, add the following `toggleFavorite()` method:

 ```javascript
    toggleFavorite () {
        const { mainView: { router } } = this.$f7;
        if (this.displayingFavorite) {
          // let the animation happen before removing the fave
          setTimeout(() => {
            toggleFavorite(this.item);
          }, 410);
          router.back();
        } else {
          toggleFavorite(this.item);
        }
    },
```

  This code runs when the star icon is clicked to toggle the *favorite* status of the item. It will take a different course based on whether it was displayed as a result of a click on a Favorited list item or not:

  - If it was shown from the favorites list, it was already favorited, so clicking the star is essentially *unfavoriting* it, and as a result the item will be removed from the favorites array (via the API call to `toggleFavorite`). At this time the view is also reset (via `router.back()`).
  - If it was shown from the regular results list, the `toggleFavorite` function is called directly and the view does not need to reset (since the user could still *unfavorite* it again).

  <div class="alert--tip">Note that there are two `toggleFavorite` methods used above, an instance `toggleFavorite` method and the `toggleFavorite` method imported from the API defined in **`favorite.js`**. The instance method simply calls the API method of the same name.</div>
	
## Run it!    
1. Begin by doing a search and favoriting an item using the star icon. 
2. Ensure the icon toggles to a filled in star:

    ![](/images/stockpile/details-with-faves.png)
    
3. Then use the side menu to navigate to your Favorites page and ensure you see your item added:

    ![](/images/stockpile/favorites-page.png)

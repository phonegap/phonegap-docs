There are multiple ways to open an existing project in PhoneGap Desktop, similar to project creation. Once your project is loaded into PhoneGap Desktop it will automatically become the active project and start running on the local web server. Then you can test it out by [pairing it](/references/desktop-app/pair-with-dev-app//) with the **PhoneGap Developer App** running on your mobile device.

## Open Project Options

### 1. Using the Plus Button

   To open an existing project, click on the **+** button in the side menu:
   ![Add Project Button](/images/docs-plus-button.png)

   Choose **Add existing PhoneGap project** from the options presented:
   ![Create Project Button](/images/docs-open-existing.png)

### 2. Using the File Menu

  Click **File -> Open Project** in the menu bar to open an existing project.

### 3. Using Drag & Drop

  Drag a file or folder anywhere onto the PhoneGap Desktop's interface and it will also trigger the dialog below. Choose
  **Add existing PhoneGap project**.

### Select Existing Project

After choosing one of the methods above, you will be prompted with a file selection dialog. Choose the root project folder for the existing PhoneGap project you wish to open in PhoneGap Desktop. It will immediately be set as the active project and started on the local web server.

### Next Steps

Once you've selected the folder that contains a valid existing project, it will be added to the list of projects displayed in PhoneGap Desktop's interface and started on the local web server. It's also ready to be [paired with the PhoneGap Developer App](/references/desktop-app/pair-with-dev-app) for easy preview and testing.

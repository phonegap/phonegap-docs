The ***active*** project is the project currently being served on the local web server by PhoneGap Desktop and there can only be one ***active*** project at any given time. PhoneGap Desktop denotes the ***active*** project with  a green left border and green play button. You will also notice a grey "stop" button displayed below the play button for the ***active*** project only.

An ***inactive*** project is any other project that has been created or opened in PhoneGap Desktop but is not currently being served on the local web server.

In the screenshot below, the first project is ***active*** and the second project is ***inactive***.

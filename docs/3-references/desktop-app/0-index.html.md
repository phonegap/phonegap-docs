## Overview

The PhoneGap Desktop App is the easiest way to get started with PhoneGap. It's an alternative to the PhoneGap CLI yet uses the same libraries behind the scenes with no complicated installation. You don't need `git`, `npm`, or even `Node.js`, you simply install it to your desktop, create a project and run it on your device.

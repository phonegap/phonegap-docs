You can use the PhoneGap CLI to get general or specific help in a number of ways. You can use it as a command with any combination of other commands to list out help for that command or use the `-h` or `--h` options before or after any command.

## Usage

```bash
phonegap help             Displays the full help text
phonegap help <command>   Displays help text for a specific command
phonegap <command> help   Displays help text for a specific command
phonegap <command> --help Displays help text for a specific command
phonegap <command> -h     Displays help text for a specific command
```

## Examples

$ phonegap help create
$ phonegap create help
$ phonegap create --help
$ phonegap create -h
```

<div class="alert--warning">You should ensure you have the [latest version](/getting-started/1-install-phonegap/desktop) of PhoneGap Desktop before getting started.</div>

PhoneGap makes it easy to take advantage of the browser target by automatically adding it as an additional platform when your apps are *served* (run on a local web server).

In the image below, when the arrow (>) is green it implies that PhoneGap project is being served on the IP Address shown in the green bar at the bottom.

You can then open that IP Address directly in your browser (or via `http://localhost:<portNumber>`) and start debugging. You can also start making edits to your source code and see the changes immediately in the browser without having to restart due to the built-in live reload feature.

<div class="alert--tip">**TIP:** You can change the port number used for serving your projects via the [PhoneGap Desktop settings](/references/desktop-app/edit-settings).</div>

<div class="alert--info">**Note:** If you're new to PhoneGap Desktop, check out the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/1-install-phonegap/desktop).</div>

The browser platform support ensures the `deviceready` event is fired in the browser and allows you to use all of the core plugins without disrupting your development.

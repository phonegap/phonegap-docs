## Multiple Platform Support

The addition of the browser platform does not affect the multi-device functionality that was already present when serving apps. You can now serve your apps and test them in the browser as well as on any Android, iOS or Windows device or simulator all at the same time with live reloading, providing an efficient workflow for concurrent development and testing.

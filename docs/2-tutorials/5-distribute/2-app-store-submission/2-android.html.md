### Google Play Publisher Account Details
The [Google Play Publisher Account](http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/start.html) registration is a *one-time* payment of **$25** paid using Google Wallet. 
Once you're ready to start publishing apps for purchase you'll be required to set up a 
[Google Wallet Merchant account}(http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/start.html).
 
<div class="alert--warning">**NOTE:** A Google User account is required to sign up for a Google Play Developer account, but if you don't have one you will be able to sign up for one in the process.</div>

### Expected Timeframe
Google recently implemented a [new manual approval process](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/03/creating-better-user-experiences-on.html) after previously not having one but 
developers should not notice a delay in approval times and find them still within hours and 
 not days. Developers should also expect to fill out a rating questionnaire for your app as part of this new approval process.    


### Resources
- Your application packaged in the form of an `.apk` file. See the [packaging docs](distribute/packaging-provisioning/android) 
for more details on creating that file.
- Artwork:
  - Minimum of 2 screenshots for the Google Play store listing but up to 8 for each resolution
  - High-res icon for store listing
  - Featured Graphic (if you want your app to be shown in featured listings)
  - Promo Graphic (optional - for use with older Android devices &lt; 4.0)
  - Promo Video (optional but highly recommended) 
  
  <div class="alert--warning">**NOTE:** The launch icons, splash screens and notification icons should have been included in your packaged app. </div>

Remote debugging is the process of debugging an application running on a device from your computer, either over a network or via USB.

There are multiple options for remote debugging your applications you'll want to be aware of since they provide a more true experience when running your application and how it will feel on the actual device. Some popular options are explained below.

## iOS Remote Debugging via Safari

This feature was introduced in iOS6 and allows you to use the Safari web browser to debug web applications running on iOS devices, and this includes PhoneGap apps.

### Requirements

- Mac OS X
- USB Cable
- Safari Version 6.0+
- iOS Device or Simulator

<div class="alert--info">**TIP:** You can remote debug a PhoneGap application running on a simulator if you don't have a device handy for testing. If you're using the PhoneGap CLI in particular, ensure to install [ios-sim](https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim) to easily launch and simulate your apps on iOS.</div>

### Steps

1. Connect your iOS Device to your computer via USB
1. Enable Web Inspector on the device:
  - Open **Settings**, click on **Safari**, then **Advanced** from your device and turn on the Web Inspector toggle as shown below:

  ```sh
  $ phonegap run ios
  $ phonegap run ios --emulator
  ```
1. Open the newly enabled **Develop** menu in Safari and locate the name of your connected device in the drop down:

## Creating Apps with PhoneGap and iOS Native Components

Before getting started you should read [this blog post](http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/03/12/mobile-choices-post1/) about choosing a mobile strategy. As a quick refresher, the type of app we're referring to here includes a blend of native controls and one or more webviews. One common use case implemented in many popular apps (Instagram, Basecamp) is to use native controls to provide the navigation and page transitions, with the main content wrapped in embedded Cordova webviews. However, you could combine the native and webview components in many different ways to achieve your needs. This guide is meant as a reference to help you start that journey.

The picture below helps denote the differences between a traditional PhoneGap hybrid app (left) and a native hybrid app approach (right):

![](/images/hybrid-apps.png)

## Options

There are some different options available to achieve this mixed native iOS and WebView approach and this guide will cover two of them. The first is the recommended approach as it uses the popular iOS [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) approach and is ultimately easier to set up and get started with, (even if you've never heard of or used CocoaPods). The 2nd manual approach is an option for those who do not want to use a [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) approach and would like to use a more raw solution or have more control over the dependency setup. Choose from one of these options below to continue:

- <a href="#pods">CocoaPods Approach (recommended)</a>
- <a href="#manual">Manual Approach</a>

<a class="anchor" id="pods"></a>

### Option 1: Combining iOS Native and WebView Components with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for building iOS projects, similar to how `npm` is used for node.js projects. To continue this analogy, a `Podfile` is used to specify those dependencies similar to how the `package.json` is used for `npm`. Since CocoaPods is built on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), you install it using the Ruby `gem` command (you may or may not need `sudo` depending on your permissions) shown below:

```sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Once you have CocoaPods installed, you'll need a native iOS project to work with.

1. Open an existing native iOS project or create a new native iOS project. To create a new project in Xcode, go to **File->New->Project** and select an iOS project template. In this example we'll choose the *Single View Controller* project template for simplicity.

   ![](/images/step1.png)

  <div class="alert--info">**Note:** Your native project can be either *Objective-C* or *Swift* based and the instructions below are the same for both.
  Once you want to refer specifically to Cordova-based classes from your Swift classes however, you will need some further instructions which can be found in
  the <a href="#swift">Swift section</a>.</div>

1. Go back to the command line, `cd` into the root of the new iOS project from above and create  a `Podfile` to manage your dependencies. The easiest way to create one is to use the `pod init` command, which creates a base one to start with.

  Type `pod init` now and make sure you see your newly created `Podfile` after you hit enter:

  ```sh
  $ pod init
  ```

  Open it and replace the contents with those from [this `Podfile` sample](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-webview-ios/blob/master/Podfile_sample) from the reference application. Only copy the contents prior to the `target` specification lines. The targets should already be set to the name of your project automatically if you used the `pod init` (see this [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Q6ak7UfvQ) for help if needed).

  ```ruby
  # Define a global platform for your project
  platform :ios, '8.0'

  # CordovaLib Dependency Pod
  pod 'Cordova'

  # Cordova Core Plugin Dependency Pod References

  pod 'CordovaPlugin-console'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-camera'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-contacts'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-device'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-device-orientation'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-device-motion'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-globalization'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-geolocation'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-file'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-media-capture'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-network-information'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-splashscreen'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-inappbrowser'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-file-transfer'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-statusbar'
  pod 'cordova-plugin-vibration'

  # The following includes the PhoneGap iOS Platform Project Template for a quick start
  pod 'phonegap-ios-template'

  # Change the target value to the name of your native Xcode project
  target 'YourNativeProj' do

  end

  target 'YourNativeProjTests' do

  end

  target 'YourNativeProjUITests' do

  end
  ```

   <div class="alert--info">**Note:** The `Cordova` CocoaPod is specified first and contains all of the `CordovaLib` core classes. The sample Podfile also specifies a number of plugin dependencies to make those available for use in your apps.  Lastly, the `phonegap-ios-template` refers to a PhoneGap sample app `CocoaPod` that's included to help you get started quickly. The sample app uses the plugins listed in this `Podfile` sample so you can test them out easily as well.</div>

1. Next, run `pod install` from the command line to install the Cordova dependencies defined above:

  ![](/images/step-install.png)

1. Close the Xcode project you created in step 1. From now on you'll need to use the Xcode workspace file that's been created for your project instead with all of the dependencies added.

1. Open the newly created `.xcworkspace` file created from the `pod install`. Ensure you see the new `Pods` folder in the Xcode Workspace for your project and that it has all the Cordova dependencies as shown below:

  ![](/images/pods-workspace.png)

1. Now you can start using Cordova in your native project. To do so, open the `Main.storyboard` file and change the Custom Class value from the default `ViewController` to`CDVViewController` in the *Identity Inspector*. The `CDVViewController` is a Cordova-specific ViewController.

 ![](/images/step-vc.png)

1. Run your app now from Xcode. The [PhoneGap iOS sample app](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-webview-ios) that was included in the CocoaPod dependencies will be run by default (see <a href="#how">the explanation section</a> for exactly how this works).

  <img class="mobile-image" src="/images/template-run.png" alt="Template run"/>

  The sample app CocoaPod folder is outlined in the project below to point it out specifically. When you're ready to start using your own code for the webview, simply replace the contents in the `www` folder with your own app content and it will be linked up and ready to go.

  ![](/images/ios-template.png)

<a class="anchor" id="how"></a>

### How Does this Work?

If you're wondering how this all just automatically works and the sample app is loaded, it's due to the way the CocoaPod for the `phonegap-webview-ios` template was configured. The [`.podspec`](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-webview-ios/blob/master/phonegap-ios-template.podspec) is a file that configures a CocoaPod, and in the definition for the `phonegap-ios-template`, a `resources` attribute is set that points to the files within the `resources` folder (which is the `www` and `config.xml` for the sample app). The `podspec` is shown below for reference:

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|

  s.name               = "phonegap-ios-template"
  s.version            = "0.1.4"
  s.summary            = "PhoneGap sample template project for iOS."

  s.description        = <<-DESC "A PhoneGap sample project to get started quickly with an embedded webview in a native iOS project."
                         DESC
  s.license            = { :type => "Apache License, Version 2.0", :file => "LICENSE" }
  s.homepage           = "https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-webview-ios"
  s.author             = { "The Adobe PhoneGap Team" => "" }
  s.social_media_url   = "http://twitter.com/phonegap"
  s.source             = { :git => "https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-webview-ios.git", :tag => "0.1.4" }
  s.resources          = "resources/*"

end
```

Xcode will copy files and folders marked as `resources` into the target app bundle at runtime by producing special build instructions for it. For instance,
the build script generated by Xcode for a project including this CocoaPod generates these lines:

```bash
if [[ "$CONFIGURATION" == "Debug" ]]; then
  install_resource "phonegap-ios-template/resources/config.xml"
  install_resource "phonegap-ios-template/resources/www"
fi
if [[ "$CONFIGURATION" == "Release" ]]; then
  install_resource "phonegap-ios-template/resources/config.xml"
  install_resource "phonegap-ios-template/resources/www"
fi
```

The `.app` bundle file created after your app has been run shows the end result if you display the contents:

 ![](/images/app-file.png)

The [`CDVViewController`](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/Public/CDVViewController.m) class that was set in the Storyboard scans your project for the
existence of a `www` folder and index.html file by default as shown from the snippet here:

```ruby
if (self.wwwFolderName == nil){
   self.wwwFolderName = @"www";
}
if (delegate.startPage && self.startPage == nil){
   self.startPage = delegate.startPage;
}
if (self.startPage == nil) {
   self.startPage = @"index.html";
}
```

Since the template app `www` etc was included in the app bundle, it's found and used it by default.

<div class="alert--tip">**Tip:** The default folder and start page values can be overridden in the config.xml &lt;content&gt; tag or in your own custom class extending `CDVViewController`.  If you want to use multiple Cordova webviews in your native app, you would want to have a custom `ViewController` class for each with those set to different folders and start pages. </div>

<div class="alert--warning">**Warning:** Be careful to ensure you don't delete the `www` folder itself since it's pre-wired as a folder reference in Xcode and if deleted the pre-wiring will be broken.</div>

Check out this short [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Q6ak7UfvQ) that shows the above process in entirety for further reference.

#### Custom ViewController

The `CDVViewController` was used directly in this example for simplicity. In your own apps you'll likely want to extend that class to customize your Cordova webview further by changing the size of the viewport for instance, if you're displaying it along with other native components in a view since it defaults to full screen by default. The [PhoneGap iOS project template](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/tree/master/bin/templates/project/__PROJECT_NAME__/) is a good example to look at for how to extend it since it does so in the [`MainViewController` class and header file here](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/tree/master/bin/templates/project/__PROJECT_NAME__/Classes). You can simply copy those into your project and reference `MainViewController` instead for the ViewController class name in your Storyboard and customize it accordingly. For example, to change the initial size of the viewport, you can change the bounds within your custom ViewController `viewWillAppear` method, such as (where the value 40 is an arbitrary offset for demonstration purposes):

    - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
    {
        CGRect viewBounds = self.view.bounds;
        CGRect webViewBound = CGRectMake(viewBounds.origin.x,
                                         viewBounds.origin.y + 40,
                                         viewBounds.size.width,
                                         viewBounds.size.height - 40);

        self.webView.frame = webViewBound;
        self.webView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];

        [super viewWillAppear:animated];
    }

<a class="anchor" id="swift"></a>

### Swift-based Projects

As mentioned above, you can use Swift-based projects with Cordova using the same CocoaPods approach just described. You will need to add a bridging header
file when you want to start extending or using the Cordova classes (written in Objective-C) to allow you to communicate with Objective-C classes from your
Swift classes.

To set up a bridge header from Xcode:

1. Go to **File->New->File->Header File**, choose a name, and save it to the root of your Xcode project.
1. Next you need to ensure the bridge header file name is set in the build settings for the project. To do so, click on the root of the project in the navigator. Then in the **Build Settings** tab, look for the **Swift Compiler - Code Generation** section and enter your header file name for *Objective-C bridging header*. An example is shown below:

 ![](/images/bridge-header.png)

1. Now go back to your bridge header file and import the header files for the Cordova classes you wish to use in your project. For example:

  ```objc
  #ifndef bridge_header_h
  #define bridge_header_h

  #import "CDVViewController.h"

  #endif /* bridge_header_h */
  ```

1. Once the headers have been added to your bridging file, you can starting using them in your Swift code directly. For instance, in a `ViewController.swift` file you might use something like the following to extend the `CDVViewController` class and resize the webview frame:

  ```swift
  import UIKit
  class SecondViewController: CDVViewController {

      override func viewDidLoad() {
           super.viewDidLoad()
          // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
      }

      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
          super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
          // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
      }
      override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
       super.viewWillAppear(true);
       self.webView.frame = CGRectMake(
           self.view.bounds.origin.x,
           self.view.bounds.origin.y+40,
           self.view.bounds.width,
           self.view.bounds.height-40)
      }
  }
  ```
See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTV-tNzWxGc) to understand how to use Cordova in a Swift-based project with a live demonstration.

<a class="anchor" id="manual"></a>

### Option 2: Combining iOS Native and WebView Components from Scratch

In this section we'll cover the manual approach to combining iOS native components with Cordova webview components.

### Reference App

We'll use this [sample application](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-sample-hybrid-ios) for reference throughout the tutorial. It contains two views;
a Cordova view and a native view. The final sample app will have a button on the Cordova webview that will add an item to a table control in the native view to
represent a bookmark to show how to communicate between the web and native views.

### Lesson 1: Create a Default Cordova iOS Project

Most developers use the PhoneGap or Cordova CLI to create their projects, and while it is possible to use it for this approach, it's not recommended since
we are only working with the iOS platform project itself. Instead, we'll use the [cordova-ios](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios) project. This is the same
project used from the CLI when you add the iOS platform.

1. Begin by cloning or downloading the zip file for the base [cordova-ios](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios) project.

1. Open a terminal window and `cd` into the directory *containing* the cordova-ios base project from above. So for instance if it was downloaded to `userxyz/cordova-ios` then you'll want to run the `create` command from `userxyz`. Create a new Cordova iOS project by running the following command:

  ```sh
  $ cordova-ios/bin/create HybridIOSApp org.sample.hybridiosapp HybridIOSApp
  ```

1. `cd` into the newly created project:

  ```sh
  $ cd HybridIOSApp
  ```

1. Use [plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman) to add any desired plugins to your project. If you don't have plugman, you can install it via npm. (You should add the [Cordova console plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-console) at minimum on iOS so you can receive log messages):

  ```sh
  $ plugman install --platform ios --project . --plugin cordova-plugin-console
  ```

### Lesson 2: Set up the Storyboard

1. Open the `HybridIOSApp.xcodeproj` file in Xcode (requires Mac OS). This is the base native project we're extending.

1. Create an iOS storyboard to lay out each screen as a 'scene'. Ensure you have the `Classes` folder of your `HybridIOSApp` project selected and use the Xcode **File -> New** menu to create a storyboard file and name it `Main.storyboard`.

 ![](/images/new-storyboard.jpg)

1. Set the main interface for the project to the Storyboard just created. This new storyboard file created in the previous step will serve as the main interface for your application, so before going further you need to update the project properties to point to it. Select the project root in the *Project Navigator* on the left and the first tab General, should be selected. Set **Devices** to iPhone if not already set, then set the **Main Interface** drop down to the `Main.storyboard` file you created. The screenshot below outlines all of this in red.

  ![](/images/main-interface.jpg)

1. Now go back to the storyboard and create a scene by dragging a View Controller in from the *Object Library* panel on the right. (If it's not already opened, toggle it from the Xcode main menu bar under **View -> Utilities**).  The right arrow below shows where to drag it from. Once it's dragged in, you should see it in the *Document Outline* view as shown below. If that outline is not showing, toggle it using the button pointed to with the red arrows below. You will need to use it throughout this guide.

  ![](/images/view-controller.jpg)

1. Next we'll need to set the View Controller class to `MainViewController`, which is the Cordova-enabled View Controller class created in your base project and provides the access to the PhoneGap APIs. To do this, ensure the new View Controller is selected and then open the *Identity Inspector* panel (circled below) and change the class name to `MainViewController`.

  ![](/images/main-view-controller.jpg)

1. In the *Attributes Inspector* tab (circled in red), set the View Controller title to **Cordova**. This will display in the *Document Outline* for the view and helps better keep track of which view we're working on.

  ![](/images/cordova-title.jpg)

1. Next let's add one more View Controller to our storyboard to represent a Native View scene. Leave the default class set to `UIViewController` since it's representing a native view scene. Set the title in the *Attributes Inspector* tab to **Native**.

  ![](/images/native-title.png)

1. Now let's put some navigation into our app by adding a `TabBarController` to allow users to switch between the cordova and native views from tabs at the bottom of the application. Our two View Controllers for Native and Cordova views can be embedded into this `TabBarController` via the Xcode *Editor* menu. Ensure you have both View Controllers selected then go to **Editor-> Embed In-> Tab Bar Controller**.

  ![](/images/embed-in.png)

1. You will see that a new `TabBarController` is now placed on the screen and connected to your View Controllers automatically.

  ![](/images/tabbar.png)

1. Now we'll need to set an entry point for our app to know what to display first. We'll set the `TabBarController` to be the entry point by clicking on the *Attribute Inspector* tab and checking the box next to *Is Initial View Controller* like below. When the box is checked you'll see an arrow added to the screen into the `TabBarController`.

  ![](/images/initial-view.jpg)

1. The storyboard entry point set in the previous step will not take effect quite yet as we still have code that exists to programmatically set the entry point as well that needs to be removed. Open **AppDelegate.m** and search for `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`. This method is the point where any final customization or final tweaks can be done before displaying the app. Since we're using a storyboard and have already set an entry point into the `TabBarController` there, we don't need to use the current code in this method to set the `rootViewController` so go ahead and completely remove it.

1. In each of the scenes in the *Document Outline* view you will notice an **Item** object which represents the tab displayed for each view.

  ![](/images/items-change.jpg)

1. Change the name and icon to represent something more meaningful for each of them in the *Attribute Inspector*. For the Cordova view, set the name to Cordova and then choose a cordova logo for the Cordova view tab in the drop-down. Since the default logos are already included in the Resources folder from the cordova-ios project, you can easily select one from the drop-down. Choose the *icon-40.png* size.

  ![](/images/cordova-title.jpg)

  For the native view we'll simply set the *System Item* to a built-in value of *History* since this view will represent a history of bookmarked items of sorts. Setting this value will automatically set the icon and title for us in the tab so we only need to fill in that value. See the screenshot in the next step for the result:

  ![](/images/native-title.png)

1. Now run the app and you will see the two buttons at the bottom and can toggle between views with them. The Cordova view shows the default Hello Cordova app and the native view is currently blank. We will change that in the next lesson.

### Lesson 3: Adding to the Native View

In this lesson we'll set up a table in our native view to allow for items to be added to it and displayed when a button is clicked from the Cordova WebView. To set up our native view to display a table, we'll also need to define a custom `UITableViewController` class for our logic.

1. Go to **File -> New -> File -> Cocoa Touch Class**

  ![](/images/cocoa-touch-class.png)

1. Name it to `MyTableViewController` and ensure the `UITableViewController` subclass is selected and save into **Classes** folder.

  ![](/images/table-view-controller-name.png)

1. Next we'll need to use the new `TableViewController` class we created by setting it as our native View Controller from within the Storyboard of our native view. Ensure the native scene is selected and change the View Controller class to `MyTableViewController` (or to the value you named it in the above) in the *Identity Inspector*.

  ![](/images/table-view-controller-class.png)

1. Since there's still nothing visible from a UI perspective in the native view, we'll need to add the actual Table control itself that the `MyTableViewController` class will manage. This control is represented by a `UITableView` class and will replace the current default `UIView` there (denoted by the *View* object in the *Document Outline*). Delete the current View In the *Document Outline* located under Native View by selecting it and pressing delete. Now drag a *Table View* component from the *Object Library* into the Native View. The result should look like the following:

  ![](/images/tableview.jpg)

1. While we have our `TableView` selected, let's also change the row height to pad it a bit and make it easier to read. Change the *Row Height* to 70 as shown here:

  ![](/images/row-height.jpg)

1. Now add a *Table View Cell* component on to the `TableView` by dragging it from the *Object Library*. You will see a new element on the Table View titled Prototype Cells. Name the Table View Cell to **Cell1** by setting the Identifier in the *Attribute Inspector* tab. The name will change in the *Document Outline* as shown below:

  ![](/images/cell-title.jpg)

1. Next drag a Label on to the Table Cell View (*Cell1*) to represent the title of the item added. Name the new label **Title** and drag it over to the left to align it as shown below:

  ![](/images/title.jpg)

1. We are now done working with the Storyboard and UI. In this step we'll need to add some code handling for this new table by updating the `MyTableViewController` header and class.

  We will use an array to manage the items for the table and name the array variable bookmarks.  To support the new array variable, we'll first need to define it as a property in the `MyTableViewController.h` header file.

  ```objc
  @property (nonatomic,strong) NSMutableArray* bookmarks;
  ```

  Next open the **MyTableViewController.m** class and make the following changes:

  - Add this new method above the `viewDidLoad` method to initialize the bookmarks array:

    ```objc
    - (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder {
       self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];
       self.bookmarks = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
       return self;
    }
    ```

  - Update the `numberOfSectionsInTableView` method to return 1 instead of 0:

    ```objc
    - (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView {
      return 1;
    }
    ```

  - For `numberOfRowsInSection`, return the current count of the `bookmarks` array:

    ```objc
    - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
      return [self.bookmarks count];
    }
    ```

  - Lastly, uncomment and update the `cellForRowAtIndexPath` to contain the following code:

    ```objc
    - (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
     UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@"Cell1" forIndexPath:indexPath];
     cell.textLabel.text=[self.bookmarks objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
     return cell;
    }
    ```

### Run it!

Now stop and run your application in the emulator or on your iPhone. You should see a blank table now for the Native **History** view as shown here:

<img class="mobile-image" src="/images/running-empty.png" alt="Running empty"/>

In the next lesson we'll show how you can add items to this table from a WebView button control by communication via a plugin.

### Troubleshoot

If you have any errors upon run, double check your code updates above against the sample project and ensure your Storyboard matches. You should also specifically check to ensure your Native View Controller outlets look the same as in this screenshot below and the **View -> Table View** is shown as an Outlet.

  ![](/images/troubleshoot.jpg)

Also check to ensure the scheme and target device you're trying to run are properly set up in the top bar as shown here. Your app name should be set as the scheme, and the iPhone 6 simulator or your own device:

  ![](/images/target.png)

### Lesson 4: Web to Native Communication

The way to communicate between the Cordova and native iOS views is via a Cordova plugin. Let's create our own custom plugin now and we'll see how we can gain access to the `TableViewController` to add an item to the table.

Cordova plugins for iOS extend the `CDVPlugin` class, can return a result using the `CDVPluginResult` class and are called from JavaScript via the `cordova.exec` interface. The `exec` interface signature takes callback functions for success and error, a service name, method name and an array of optional arguments as follows:

```js
exec(<successFunction>, <failFunction>, <service>, <action>, [<args>]);
```

The `service` parameter maps to the name of the iOS class to call and the action specifies the function within that class to execute using any arguments passed in from the last parameter. Upon success, the success callback function will be called, otherwise the error callback function will be called. The `CDVPluginResult` will hold the specific result, which can hold a variety of result types in the message. For instance, a simple result for a success status may have the form of the following where you're sending back the success status only:

```js
pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK];
```

or you could also pass a message string with it as follows:

```js
pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK messageAsString:myStr];
```

When an error results, you will likely want to pass a message or object back indicating details about the failure. Below is an example of passing a message back, but you could also pass the error status along with a message or another data type (`messageAsArrayBuffer`, `messageAsMultipart` etc).

```js
pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_ERROR messageAsString:@"Arg was null"];
```

### Create a Cordova Plugin

Start creating your custom plugin by going to the **Xcode File -> New -> File** menu and selecting Cocoa Touch. Ensure to choose the `CDVPlugin` as the subclass for your new plugin and name it something like `MyHybridPlugin` and save into your **Classes** folder.

Now update the `MyHybridPlugin.h` header file to look like the following:

```objc
#import <Cordova/CDVPlugin.h>

  @interface MyHybridPlugin : CDVPlugin
      - (void)addBookmark:(CDVInvokedUrlCommand*) command;
  @end
```

<div class="alert--info">**Note:** Ensure your import statement uses `CDVPlugin.h` as Xcode may try to default it to Cordova.h and it will not work.</div>

Next open the `MyHybridPlugin.m` class file and modify it to the following:

```objc
#import "MyHybridPlugin.h"
#import "MainViewController.h"
#import "MyTableViewController.h"

@implementation MyHybridPlugin
    -(void)addBookmark:(CDVInvokedUrlCommand*) command {
        NSString* bookmark = [command.arguments objectAtIndex:0];

        if(bookmark) {
            NSLog(@"addBookmark %@", bookmark);
            MainViewController* mvc = (MainViewController*)[self viewController];

            MyTableViewController* tvc = (MyTableViewController*)mvc.tabBarController.viewControllers[1];
            [tvc.bookmarks addObject:bookmark];
            [tvc.tableView reloadData];
            CDVPluginResult* pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK];
            [self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];
        } else {
            CDVPluginResult* pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_ERROR];
            [self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];
        }
    }
@end

```

### Code Dissection

Here's an explanation of what is happening above...

1. Since we're running in the `MainViewController` when the button is clicked, we can get access to that controller via this line:

  ```objc
  MainViewController* mvc = (MainViewController*)[self viewController];
  ```

1. Now we'll use our `MainViewController` object to gain access to our `TabBarController` and subsequently the native view `TableViewController` object via it's `ViewController` array at index 1 (`MainViewController` is at index 0).

  ```objc
  MyTableViewController* tvc = (MyTableViewController*)mvc.tabBarController.viewControllers[1];
  ```

1. Next we'll add a bookmark object to the array of bookmarks held in the `TableViewController` object:

  ```objc
  [tvc.bookmarks addObject:bookmark];
  ```

1. Now we'll call the `reloadData` function to reload the data in the table view since the array (the datasource) has changed.

  ```objc
  [tvc.tableView reloadData];
  ```

1. Lastly we'll form our Plugin Result via the `CDVPluginResult` classes discussed previously in this guide and return the plugin result status back using the `commandDelegate`:

  ```objc
  CDVPluginResult* pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK];
      [self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];
  }
  else {
      CDVPluginResult* pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_ERROR];
      [self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];
  }
  ```

<div class="alert--info">Also, notice in the above that the name of the class is `MyHybridPlugin` and the name of the method being called is `addBookmark`. To use this new plugin from the Cordova JavaScript side we will use the following syntax and specify those values in the `exec` call along with our callbacks and parameters (the string to add to the native table view):

  ```js
  cordova.exec(win, fail, "MyHybridPlugin", "addBookmark", [bookmark]);
  ```

</div>

### Use the Plugin

1. Now open your Cordova **index.js** file located in the project under the `www/js` folder and add a method on the JavaScript side called `addBookmark` that will call the `addBookmark` method in the plugin via the `exec` call (highlighted in red).

  ```js
  addBookmark: function() {
    var win = function(d) {
      console.log("Bookmark added!");
    };
    var fail = function(e) {
      console.log(e)
    }
    var bookmark = document.getElementById("bookmark").value;
    cordova.exec(win, fail, "MyHybridPlugin", "addBookmark", [bookmark]);
  }
  ```

1. Open **index.html** and replace the `div` contents with a new text input and button:

  ```html
  <div class="app">
    <label for="bookmark">Bookmark this:</label>
    <input id="bookmark" type="text" />
    <button id="bookmarkBtn">Add a bookmark</button>
  </div>
  ```

1. Now go back into **index.js** and in the `onDeviceReady` function, delete or comment out the `receivedEvent` call (since we removed the corresponding code from index.html in the previous step) and add the following line to call our `addBookmark` function when the button is clicked:

  ```js
  onDeviceReady: function() {
    //app.receivedEvent('deviceready');
    document.getElementById("bookmarkBtn").onclick = app.addBookmark;
  },
  ```

1. None of this will work yet until we update our **config.xml** file with the new plugin details in the form of a `<feature/>` tag so it knows it's a valid plugin and how to reference it. Open the **config.xml** file located in the project at the same level as the `Classes` folder we've been working out of (at path: `HybridIOSApp/HybridIOSApp/config.xml`) and add the following lines in the same area as any other feature elements already added if you added other plugins. (Since we didn't use a tool like plugman or the CLI to add our plugin, we must do this step manually).

  ```xml
  <feature name="MyHybridPlugin">
    <param name="ios-package" value="MyHybridPlugin" />
  </feature>
  ```

1. Run your app now and ensure you can enter text into the input field on the Cordova screen, click the *Add a bookmark* button and see it added into your native view. Keep adding items and see them added into your native table view!

### Conclusion

While it may not be the most aesthetically pleasing looking app, it illustrates how easily you can combine native and webview elements to get you thinking about more options in approaching this for your own hybrid app development!

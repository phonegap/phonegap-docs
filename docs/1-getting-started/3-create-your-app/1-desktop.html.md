Now that you've installed [PhoneGap Desktop](/getting-started/1-install-phonegap/desktop) and/or the [PhoneGap CLI](/getting-started/1-install-phonegap/cli) to your computer and the [PhoneGap Developer App](/getting-started/2-install-mobile-app) to your mobile devices, you're ready to create your first PhoneGap project. This project will be a PhoneGap mobile app with the ability to run on multiple devices and across operating systems
in just a few simple steps.

## Create a PhoneGap Project

1. Click the plus sign and select **Create new PhoneGap project** as shown below:

1. You will be prompted with the template list dialog as shown below, where you can choose to create an app based on a sample project.

Each template has a brief description below the name indicating what type of project will be created. To select a template, click on the radio button next to it. In the image below, the **Hello World** template is selected.

The first template option in the list is the default Hello World project. It's proven to be the quickest and easiest way to understand the
basics of building a mobile PhoneGap app so let's start there.

1. Ensure the radio button next to the **Hello World** template is selected.

1. Click on the green **Next** button.

1. You will be presented with a screen to enter information about your project. Choose the path on your local hard drive where you want to create the project, a designated name and an optional *identifier*. Once the information has been entered, click the green **Create project** button.

  <div class="alert--warning">Be aware that the ID field is also known as the *package identifier* for Android and the *bundle identifier* for iOS.</div>

1. You should now see a view like below, with your new project shown and marked with a left green border, a green play button next to it and a green bar at the bottom. You should also see a server address indicating it's running and the active project. Only one project will be active and running at any time.

   <div class="alert--tip">**TIP:** The server address shown for your project at the bottom in the green bar will be used in the next step so make note of it or keep it open. </div>

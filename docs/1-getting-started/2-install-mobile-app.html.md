The PhoneGap Developer App is a wrapper application that runs on your devices and allows you to preview and test the PhoneGap mobile 
apps you build on multiple devices across platforms without the need to install and set up each platform SDK.* It also automatically 
builds in all of the PhoneGap core API plugins which allow access to the native device features without you having to add them to get 
started, providing an instant sandbox for you to try PhoneGap mobile development. 

Let's get started by installing PhoneGap Developer to a device to prepare for previewing what we'll create in the next step:

1. Locate the free PhoneGap Developer mobile app from one of the following app marketplaces and install it to your mobile device:

	- [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id843536693)
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.phonegap.app)
	- [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/phonegap-developer/5c6a2d1e-4fad-4bf8-aaf7-71380cc84fe3)

2. Once installed, click on the app icon ![](/images/dev-app-icon.png) to open it. You should see a screen like the following:

3. Once you've verified your installation, move on to the next section where you will install a desktop tool to create and serve your 
first mobile application for the PhoneGap Developer app to preview.

<div class="alert--warning">**Note:**The platform SDK's refer to the software development kits Apple, Google and Microsoft provide to build applications for their platforms (iOS, Android and Windows respectively). 
 When you're ready to take your mobile application development further or decide you want to build for each platform locally yourself, you can find the specific instructions for each platform 
 in the [getting started guides](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html#Platform%20Guides).</div>

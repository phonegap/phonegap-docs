The [PhoneGap Developer App](http://app.phonegap.com) is a mobile app that runs on devices and allows you to preview and test the PhoneGap mobile
apps you build across platforms without additional platform SDK setup. It automatically provides access to the PhoneGap core APIs
providing instant access to the native device features without having to install any plugins or compile anything locally. It's meant to provide
an easy way for developers to get started creating and testing their PhoneGap applications quickly with minimal setup.

## Install PhoneGap Developer

1. Locate the free PhoneGap Developer app from one of the following supported app marketplaces and install it to your mobile device:

  - [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id843536693)
  - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.phonegap.app)
  - [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/phonegap-developer/5c6a2d1e-4fad-4bf8-aaf7-71380cc84fe3)

1. Once installed, tap the PhoneGap Developer app icon from your home screen to open it:

1. Once installed, move on to the next step where you will create your first PhoneGap app using the tool you selected in step 1.

  <div class="alert--info">**NOTE:** The platform SDKs mentioned above refer to the software development kits Apple, Google and Microsoft provide to build applications for their platforms (iOS, Android and Windows respectively).
 When you're ready to take your mobile application development further or decide you want to build for each platform locally yourself, you can find the specific instructions for each platform
 in the [PhoneGap Platform Installation Guides](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html#Platform%20Guides). </div>

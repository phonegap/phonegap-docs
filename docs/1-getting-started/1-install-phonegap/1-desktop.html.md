The PhoneGap Desktop application provides a drag and drop interface for creating PhoneGap applications. It's an alternative to using the
[PhoneGap CLI](/getting-started/1-install-phonegap/cli) built for those who prefer a visual user interface
over a command line interface approach.

<div class="alert--info"><b>NOTE:</b> The getting started steps vary based on the initial PhoneGap tool you install here in step 1. For the rest of the steps be sure to choose either the <b>Desktop</b> or <b>CLI</b> tab at the top accordingly.</div>
